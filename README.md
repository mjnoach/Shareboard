PHP, JavaScript, SQL


A demonstrative web application written in PHP combined with JavaScript and SQL.

The premise of this project was to understand the concept of MVC approach of building web apps. I have learned about the MVC project structure and gained understandment of the interconnections between the key parts of this model. Alongside I have refined my workshop of tools such as JavaScript and SQL. I believe that with the experience that I have earned I could grasp any professional MVC framework in no time.
